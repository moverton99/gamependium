    "body": "The Crew takes classic trick taking and turns it into a cooperative space mission where every hand is a tiny puzzle about timing, communication limits, and reading your teammates. Each mission gives the group one or more goals like \"Player A must win the yellow 7\" or \"this card must be taken last,\" and suddenly familiar mechanics become a shared logic challenge. \n\nThe pace is quick, the difficulty ramps smoothly, and the sense of collective triumph when a tough mission finally clicks is fantastic. The catch is that it absolutely requires focus and a steady group. If someone zones out or treats it like a casual card game, the whole thing collapses. It also works best with three or four players; at five it becomes more chaotic and less precise.\n\nThe Crew is ideal for groups who enjoy tight puzzles, cooperative planning, and the structure of trick taking. It is less appealing if your table prefers open discussion, party energy, or looser teamwork, but for thoughtful, puzzle loving groups, it is one of the best cooperatives around.",
